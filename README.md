# Blog reader interface

### What this project?
This project is part of the blog-api project by The Odin Project. This app makes it possible for readers to read the posts on the blog. It also allows readers to post comments on the blog posts. 

### How does it work?
Users can see all the public posts on the homepage of this app, private posts are hidden. Clicking on 'Read more...' opens a page that shows all the details of a post and a form for posting comments. Users can post comments by entering a name and content, an account is not required and comments can not be edited or deleted by the reader after they are posted. 

### How was it made?
This app was made using React and other npm packages (see the `package.json` file for all packages).

### Live version
The full API together with live versions of both the author and reader interface can be found [here](https://github.com/niconap/blog). This repository also contains the documentation of the API.
